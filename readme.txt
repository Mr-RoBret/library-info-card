1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

* Release

== Further context ==

The original "card" layout for individual sections content on the library homepage were styled in ColdFusion. This block replicates the style and allows any available (see: not blocked) block to be added to the innerblocks section. This provides a styled wrapper, including one of a list of predetermined icons, to keep the formatting consistent on this particular homepage. 

This might have been a custom post type, but a block seemed easier.
